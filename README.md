# data modle

To avoid confusion and maintain consistency, it’s important to define the data structure at the start.

give a example:

### **Student Data Model**

- `_id`: ObjectId (generated automatically)
- `id`: String (unique ID for the student)
- `password`: String (hashed password)

- `gender`: String (gender of the student)
- `dateOfBirth`: Date (date of birth)
- `email`: String (email address)
- `contactNo`: String (phone number)
- `emergencyContactNo`: String (emergency contact number)
- `presentAddress`: String (current address)
- `permanentAddress`: String (permanent address)
- `guardian`: String (name of the guardian)
- `localGuardian`: String (name of the local guardian)
- `profileImage`: String (URL or path to profile image)
- `status`: String (current status of the student, e.g., active, graduated)
- `isDeleted`: Boolean (soft delete flag)
- `createdAt`: Date (record creation date)
- `updatedAt`: Date (record last update date)
- `academicDepartment`: String (department the student is enrolled in)

### **Faculty Data Model**

- `_id`: ObjectId (generated automatically)

we need to create er digramTo help visualize and understand the relationships and data referencing ammabeding.

after data modaling then we need to create api endPoinst . here is a exppme:

## **API Endpoints Example**

Below are examples of RESTful API endpoints for the **Student** entity:

### **Student Routes**:

1. **GET /students** - Fetch all students
2. **GET /students/:id** - Fetch student details by ID
3. **POST /students** - Create a new student
4. **PUT /students/:id** - Update a student's profile by ID
5. **DELETE /students/:id** - Delete a student by ID

---

### **API Example for Other Entities**

#### **Faculty Routes**:

1. **GET /faculty** - Fetch all faculty members
2. **GET /faculty/:id** - Fetch faculty details by ID
3. **POST /faculty** - Create a new faculty member
4. **PUT /faculty/:id** - Update faculty profile by ID
5. **DELETE /faculty/:id** - Delete a faculty member by ID

#### **Admin Routes**:

1. **GET /admins** - Fetch all admins
2. **GET /admins/:id** - Fetch admin details by ID
3. **POST /admins** - Create a new admin
4. **PUT /admins/:id** - Update admin profile by ID
5. **DELETE /admins/:id** - Delete an admin by ID

# Project Folder Structure

This project follows the **Modular Pattern** to keep the codebase clean and maintainable. All modules (e.g., `user`, `auth`, `student`, etc.) are organized under a central `modules` directory. Each module contains files that serve specific purposes, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

## Folder Structure Overview

```
modules/
  ├── user/
  │    ├── user.controller.ts        # Handles the logic for user-related requests
  │    ├── user.interface.ts         # Defines the structure of user-related data
  │    ├── user.validation.ts        # Validates user data (input)
  │    ├── user.model.ts             # Defines the schema/model for the user entity
  │    ├── user.route.ts             # Defines the routes for user-related operations
  │    ├── user.service.ts           # Contains the business logic for user operations
  ├── auth/
  │    ├── auth.controller.ts        # Handles the logic for authentication requests
  │    ├── auth.interface.ts         # Defines the structure of authentication-related data
  │    ├── auth.validation.ts        # Validates authentication data
  │    ├── auth.model.ts             # Defines the schema/model for authentication entities (like tokens)
  │    ├── auth.route.ts             # Defines the routes for authentication operations
  │    ├── auth.service.ts           # Contains the business logic for authentication processes
  └── ... (other modules like car, booking, etc.)
```

## Module Structure Details

Each module contains the following files:

1. **Controller (`*.controller.ts`)**  
   This file handles incoming HTTP requests for the module. It acts as a middle layer between the routes and the service, delegating the business logic to the service. It is responsible for interacting with the service layer and returning the appropriate responses.

2. **Interface (`*.interface.ts`)**  
   Defines the TypeScript interfaces for data structures used in the module. It ensures consistency in data types across the module.

3. **Validation (`*.validation.ts`)**  
   Contains the logic for validating incoming data (e.g., checking if the email is valid, password strength, etc.). This file ensures that only valid data is passed to the service layer.

4. **Model (`*.model.ts`)**  
   Defines the data model (using Mongoose, Sequelize, or any other ORM/ODM) for the module's entities. The model represents how the data is structured and how it interacts with the database.

5. **Route (`*.route.ts`)**  
   Defines the API routes for the module. It sets up which controller methods should handle specific HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

6. **Service (`*.service.ts`)**  
   Contains the core business logic for the module. The service layer interacts with the database and provides methods that the controller layer calls. It handles database operations, data processing, and other core functionalities.

## Example: User Module

### user.controller.ts

Handles HTTP requests related to user actions like registration, login, and profile management.

### user.interface.ts

Defines the shape of user data, such as:

```typescript
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  name: string;
}
```

### user.validation.ts

Validates the incoming user data for registration, login, etc.

```typescript
import * as Joi from "joi";

export const userRegistrationSchema = Joi.object({
  email: Joi.string().email().required(),
  password: Joi.string().min(6).required(),
  name: Joi.string().required(),
});
```

### user.model.ts

Defines the user schema for interacting with the database (e.g., MongoDB, SQL).

```typescript
import { Schema, model } from "mongoose";

const userSchema = new Schema({
  email: { type: String, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  name: { type: String, required: true },
});

export const User = model("User", userSchema);
```

### user.route.ts

Sets up the routes for the user-related operations.

```typescript
import { Router } from "express";
import { userController } from "./user.controller";

const router = Router();

router.post("/register", userController.register);
router.post("/login", userController.login);
router.get("/profile", userController.getProfile);

export default router;
```

### user.service.ts

Contains the logic for user-related operations like saving a user to the database, authenticating, etc.

```typescript
import { User } from "./user.model";

export class UserService {
  async register(userData: any) {
    const newUser = new User(userData);
    return await newUser.save();
  }

  async authenticate(email: string, password: string) {
    // Logic to authenticate the user
  }
}
```

## Adding New Modules

When adding a new module to the project, follow the same structure as shown above:

1. **Create a new folder** for the module inside the `modules` directory.
2. **Define controller, service, model, validation, and route** files for the new module.
3. **Update the central `index.ts` file** (if applicable) to include the routes for the new module.

## Conclusion

This modular structure ensures that each feature of the application is encapsulated within its own folder, making it easier to maintain, scale, and manage the application in the long run.

This version is clearer and structured, with explanations for each part of the pattern, making it easier for developers to understand and follow the organization.
